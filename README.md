# multivariate statistical learning (unsupervised learning)
To compile in R, run .rmd file in R or paste and run .r code in R.
Datasets for projects are located in the 'Data' folder.

The following projects are multivariate statistical learning projects that I have undertaken in R. Techniques used include: principal components analysis, MANOVA, ANOVA and cluster analysis.

1. PCA Analysis (Drug Attitudes):  In this project, I apply PCA techniques on a dataset on drug attitudes in the United States to ascertain factors that account for most of the correlation across the data, i.e., which factors explain most of the drug attitude data.

2. Cluster Analysis (Breast Cancer): In this project, I run different clustering methods, namely Ward's method and the single linkage method, on the wisconsin breast cancer dataset with Manhattan and Euclidean distance measures. Then I also run KMeans clustering on the data and cross-check the results with our hierarchical clustering methods. Ultimately, the goal is to see if there are certain groups of observations that are similar. 

3. MANOVA Analysis (Ohio Crime): In this project, I apply MANOVA and ANOVA tests to data on perception of crime in Ohio. Ultimately, we want to answer the question of whether females and males answer questions differently and whether people of different races (white/black/other) answer questions on crime differently.

4. Cliuster Analysis (Yelp Reviews): This code runs different cluster analyses methods on the Yelp Reviews dataset. Here, the different clustering methods I try are Ward's Method, the average method and K-means clustering. For each method, I also employ different distance measures namely: euclidean, manhattan and maximum distance measures. Finally, I run KMeans clustering on the data and cross-check the results with our hierarchical clustering methods. Ultimately, our goal is to see if there are groups of users that review in similar ways.
